# 1.1.GUI: how to run a probabilistic based scoring function to compare two given spectra data sets
GUI application to perform the comparison of two given data sets.

**1-Start the application**: the GUI can be started by running a command prompt on a folder that contains scoring_pipeline-X.Y.Z.jar (X.Y.Z shows the current version number). On the command prompt, the following line needs to be executed:

> java -cp scoring_pipeline-X.Y.Z.jar main.ScorePipelineStarter

The GUI starts after executing this command:

**2-Set the parameters**: The details on the parameters can be found [here](/projects/spectrum_similarity/wiki/setting-parameters-of-the-gui-application).

**3-Run**: Click the `run` button to start the comparison.
