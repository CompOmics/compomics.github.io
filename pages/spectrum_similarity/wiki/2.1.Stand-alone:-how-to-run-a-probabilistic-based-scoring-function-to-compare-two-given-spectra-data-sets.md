# 2.1.Stand alone: how to run a probabilistic based scoring function to compare two given spectra data sets
The stand-alone tool can be started by running a command prompt in a folder that contains scoring_pipeline-X.Y.Z.jar (X.Y.Z shows the current version number). On the command prompt, the following line needs to be executed:

> java -cp scoring_pipeline-1.0.jar main.ScorePipeline
 
Parameters must be introduced in MS2Similarity.properties. Parameters are explained [here](https://github.com/compomics/spectrum_similarity/wiki/Setting-parameters-for-the-stand-alone-application-%28MS2Similarity.properties%29)
