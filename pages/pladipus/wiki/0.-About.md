The use of proteomics bioinformatics substantially contributes to an improved understanding of proteomes, but this novel and in-depth knowledge comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. Parallelization across multiple computers, a strategy termed distributed computing, can be used to handle this increased complexity.

However, setting up and maintaining a distributed computing infrastructure requires resources and skills that are not readily available to most research groups. Here, we propose a free and open source framework named Pladipus that greatly facilitates the establishment of distributed computing networks for proteomics bioinformatics tools. 

Pladipus is straightforward to install and operate thanks to its user friendly graphical interface, allowing complex bioinformatics tasks to be run easily on a network instead of a single computer. As a result, any 
researcher can benefit from the increased computational efficiency provided by distributed computing, hence empowering them to tackle more complex bioinformatics challenges. Notably, it enables any research group to perform large scale reprocessing of publicly available proteomics data, thus supporting the scientific community in mining these data for novel discoveries. 

Furthermore, Pladipus' design and portability allow for unique and strong collaborations that exceed the borders of multi-omics fields. Collaborations that create, improve, utilize and share pipelines, leading to an immense potential. For the first time, the distributed processing of data becomes truly public.
