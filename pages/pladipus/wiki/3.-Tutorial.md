## Preparing Pladipus

----

Some initial steps are required before the example can be run. 

* Start the activeMQ server by double clicking the executable file that was created on your desktop during the installation. Alternatively, you can run the following command: 

`java -jar $USER_HOME/pladipus/activeMQ/apache-activemq-5.11.1/bin/activemq.jar start`

* Verify that the mySQL server is running

* Launch one or more Pladipus executing instances on the machines that will connect to the Pladipus network. This is done by double clicking the batch file that was created on the desktop during the installation or by running the following command on those machines. 

`java -jar $USER_HOME/pladipus/Pladipus-execution-x.y.z/Pladipus-execution-x.y.z.jar -auto_pull -u [pladipus_user] -p [pladipus_password]`

----

## Importing The Example

----

* You can create an example run by selecting "Open example" from the File menu in the top left corner. Alternatively, it is possible to import the example by clicking the "Open Example Run" beneath the Run window.

* You will be prompted to either set this run as a local run or as a distributed run. <b>A local run</b> will require an output folder. When selecting <b>Run Distributed</b>, you will be prompted for a path, which can be a network location that is visible for all workers that are intended to participate in the search.

*After either specifying a local folder or setting the path to a result folder, launch the example run as described [here](http://compomics.github.io/pladipus/wiki/2manual.html#launching-a-run).
