## Introduction

Don't hesitate to create an issue in case of an unexpected error. It can be helpful for us to include the log files that can be found in the `.compomics` directory in the user home directory (see below).

## Client module

The client module displays error and other messages in a dialog. It also writes log files to the `.compomics` directory in the user home directory: `.compomics/colims-client.log`.

## Distributed module

The distributed module writes log files to the `.compomics` directory in the user home directory: `.compomics/colims-distributed.log`.
