## Introduction

DeepLC is a retention time predictor for (modified) peptides that employs Deep
Learning. It's strength lies in the fact that it can accurately predict
retention times for modified peptides, even if hasn't seen said modification
during training.

DeepLC can be run with a graphical user interface (GUI) or as a Python package.
In the latter case, DeepLC can be used from the command line, or as a python
module.

## Graphical user interface

...

## Python package

### Installation

Clone the repository and install with pip:

```sh
pip install .
```

### Command line interface

To use the DeepLC CLI, run:

```sh
deeplc --file_pred <path/to/peptide_file.csv>
```

We highly recommend to add a peptide file with known retention times for
calibration:

```sh
deeplc --file_pred  <path/to/peptide_file.csv> --file_cal <path/to/peptide_file_with_tr.csv>
```

For an overview of all CLI arguments, run `deeplc --help`.

### Python module

Minimal example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from deeplc import DeepLC

peptide_file = "datasets/test_pred.csv"
calibration_file = "datasets/test_train.csv"

pep_df = pd.read_csv(peptide_file, sep=",")
pep_df['modifications'] = pep_df['modifications'].fillna("")

cal_df = pd.read_csv(calibration_file, sep=",")
cal_df['modifications'] = cal_df['modifications'].fillna("")

dlc = DeepLC()
dlc.calibrate_preds(seq_df=cal_df)
preds = dlc.make_preds(seq_df=pep_df)
```

For a more elaborate example, see
[examples/deeplc_example.py](https://github.com/compomics/DeepLC/blob/master/examples/deeplc_example.py)
.

## Input files

DeepLC expects comma-separated values (CSV) with the following columns:

- `seq`: unmodified peptide sequences
- `modifications`: MS2PIP-style formatted modifications: Every modification is
  listed as `location|name`, separated by a pipe (`|`) between the location, the
  name, and other modifications. `location` is an integer counted starting at 1
  for the first AA. 0 is reserved for N-terminal modifications, -1 for
  C-terminal modifications. `name` has to correspond to a Unimod (PSI-MS) name.
- `tr`: retention time (only required for calibration)

For example:

```csv
seq,modifications,tr
AAGPSLSHTSGGTQSK,,12.1645
AAINQKLIETGER,6|Acetyl,34.095
AANDAGYFNDEMAPIEVKTK,12|Oxidation|18|Acetyl,37.3765
```

See
[examples/datasets](/projects/DeepLC/tree/master/examples/datasets)
for more examples.

## Prediction models

DeepLC comes with multiple CNN models trained on data from various experimental
settings:

| Model filename | Experimental settings | Publication | PXD identifier |
| - | - | - | - |
| full_hc_dia_fixed_mods.hdf5 | | | |
| full_hc_LUNA_HILIC_fixed_mods.hdf5 | | | |
| full_hc_LUNA_SILICA_fixed_mods.hdf5 | | | |
| full_hc_PXD000954_fixed_mods.hdf5 | | | |

By default, DeepLC selects the best model based on the calibration dataset. If
no calibration is performed, the first default model is selected. Always keep
note of the used models and the DeepLC version.
