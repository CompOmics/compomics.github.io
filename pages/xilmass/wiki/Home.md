Welcome to the xilmass wiki!

Xilmass is open-source and freely available under the permissive Apache2 license. Xilmass is platform free, therefore works on Windows, Linux and OS-X operating systems. Xilmass is implemented in Java and therefore, make sure that [JDK] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) is already installed on your computer environment. The current program works as a standalone version which can be run by following the steps described underneath, as well as GUI. 

This wiki consists of the following page:
