# Extended install instructions
## Prerequisites
MS2PIPc runs on Python 3.5 and greater. We recommend you to install a virtual environment for MS2PIPc:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Set up MS2PIPc
Download the source code of the [latest release](/projects/ms2pip_c/releases/latest.html) and unzip it. In the MS2PIPc project folder, you can find the required Python modules listed in `requirements.txt`. Install these with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MS2PIPc requires some code to be compiled. For this:
- Run the compilation with the command `sh compile.sh` (this can take a while...)
- Or, alternatively, you can use the precompiled files that are posted on the release page. Extract the files in the `cython_modules` folder. For this option to work, Linux, Python 3.7 and Cython 0.29.2 are required!

MS2PIP is now fully set up!

## Configure MS2PIPc to your use case
A few parameters need to be set in the configuration file (by default `config.txt`):
- `model`: The peptide fragmentation method or specific MS2PIP model to employ to predict peak intensities. The available models are listed in `README.md`.
- `frag_error`: The MS/MS error tolerance in Da. This defines the width of the region around theoretical fragment peak m/z's where MS2PIPc looks for emperical peaks. This value is only of importance if you provide MGF spectrum files.
- Post-translational modifications (PTMs): This part of the configuration file describes the PTMs that are present in the PEPREC file. Each line represents a certain PTM and is written as follows: `ptm=name,mass-shift,opt,AA`. The name should be identical to the PTM name that is used in the PEPREC file and is case-sensitive. Next is the mass-shift of the PTM in Da. The next variable is not relevant for MS2PIP, so it can be `opt`. Last in line is the one-letter code of the amino acid (AA) on which the PTM occurs. If a certain PTM occurs on different AAs, every AA should have it's own line in the configuration file and have a unique name (eg `PhosphoT`, `PhosphoS` and `PhosphoY`). For N- and C-terminal modifications `AA` should be `N-term` or `C-term`, respectively. This leads, for instance, to the following syntax: `ptm=name,mass-shift,opt,N-term`
- Lines can be commented out using a hashtag (`#`).

## Prepare your input data
MS2PIP always takes a PEPREC file as input. It is a space-separated file that lists all peptides. It has the following columns:
- `spec_id`: A unique ID for the peptide that, if an MGF file is given, matches with one fragmentation spectrum.
- `peptide`: Peptide sequence.
- `modifications`: PTMs for the given peptide. Every modification is listed as `name|location`, separated by a pipe (`|`) between the name, the location and other PTMs. The location is an integer counted starting at `1` for the first AA. `0` is reserved for N-terminal modifications. `Name` has to correspond to a PTM listed in the configuration file. Unmodified peptides are marked with a hyphen (`-`).
- `charge`: Precursor charge of the peptide.

Example of a PEPREC file:
```
spec_id modifications peptide charge
peptide1 - ACDE 2
peptide2 2|cam ACDEFGHI 3
peptide3 0|iTRAQ|3|Pyro_glu ACDEFGHIKMNPQ 2
```

In order to directly compare predictions to empirical spectra, or to create a feature-vector file to train new models, you will need to provide an MGF file. See the general `README.md` file for instructions on this.

## Run MS2PIPc
The basic MS2PIPc syntax is as follows:
```
python3 ms2pipC.py PEPREC
```

You can also add the following optional arguments:
```
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -c FILE         config file (by default config.txt)
  -s FILE         .mgf MS2 spectrum file (optional)
  -w FILE         write feature vectors to FILE.{pkl,h5} (optional)
  -m INT          number of cpu's to use
```

If you want to use another configuration file, you need to give the file location with the `-c` argument. The command then becomes:
```
python3 ms2pipC.py -c CONFIG-FILE PEPREC
```

That's it! MS2PIPc should now be up and running. Instructions for more advanced use-cases (such as training your own models) can be found in the `README.md` file.
